## Narrative

The siren blares.\
Four racers line up, gripping their ladders. The crowd is buzzing. You can feel the ground shake from the thundering footsteps of the other competitors.

_**BANG!**_ The start pistol fires.\
You sprint forward, ladder bouncing in your hands. The building mock-up looms ahead — four stories tall, windows like targets. In one fluid move, you hook your ladder to the ledge and leap onto it, climbing like your life depends on it. The wind rushes past as you race to reach the top before anyone else.

In another event, you face the 100-Meter Fire Challenge: leap over fences, dash across a narrow bridge, duck under beams, and hit the finish line in record time. Your reflexes, speed, and timing decide everything.

Every race is different — slippery floors, moving targets, night-time lights, even roaring fire effects for the brave. Compete against friends, climb the global leaderboard, and unlock crazy skins for your racer and ladder.

Only the fastest, smartest, and most fearless will become the ultimate Ladder Legend.\
Are you ready to climb?
